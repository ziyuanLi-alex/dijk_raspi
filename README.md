## Purpose

This project visualizes the Dijkstra's algorithm by a raspberry pi, with a 64x64 LED array.

Demos:

| LED Heart | pygame heart | led grid | pygame grid |
| --------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------- |
|     |             |          |             |



I achieved this by using the `rpi-rgb-led-matrix` library, which is a C++ library for controlling RGB LED matrices. 
I used the Python wrapper provided in this library, and used it to control the LED array.
